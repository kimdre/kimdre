### Hi, I'm Kim 👋

- 🤓 I'm a Linux and cloud admin as well as a mountainbike enthusiast from Nuremberg, Germany. 🚵‍♂️
- 💙 My preferred programming/scripting languages are Python and Shell/Bash, but I also know Tcl/Expect and PHP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Python related project to learn more about my favourite programming language!
- ⚡ My public repositories get mirrored every 8 hours from my private [Gitea instance](https://git.pyas.de).
